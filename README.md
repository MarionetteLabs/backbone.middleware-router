# marionette.router

=========
### Note: This library is a work in progress, and I wouldn't say that it's fit for production.
=========

The router is arguably one of the weakest pieces of the Backbone library. This is a
replacement for the Backbone router that provides more flexibility and greater control
over your routing callbacks.

### To Try It Out

Make sure you have `node-static` installed

`npm install node-static -g`

Run `static` from the root directory of this repository.

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:8080/example` in your browser.
